While weak password requirements can pose a security risk, the impact of this vulnerability is limited since it mainly depends on users choosing strong passwords. As a result, the difficulty of exploitation is somewhat high as it requires multiple attempts. Furthermore, the scope is unchanged, affecting only the password strength within the repository. Considering these factors, the severity label for this vulnerability is Low (0.1 - 3.9) based on CVSS V3.1 guidelines."

                "content": "You are an expert in identifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on the description of software bugs.\n\nInstructions:\n1. * Input: \n    Description: You will receive a description of a buggy code.\n    \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided description of the buggy code, list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided description of the buggy code(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided description of the buggy code(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability.

The nature of SSRF vulnerabilities allows attackers to make requests originating from the server, potentially accessing internal systems or executing other malicious actions. Although a patch is available in the mentioned versions, prior versions are still susceptible. The impact of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, possibly escalating to further attacks. The exploit complexity is moderate as it requires crafting specific requests. The required privileges are low, as an attacker does not need high permissions to trigger the vulnerability. Considering the exploit complexity, impact on confidentiality and integrity, this vulnerability falls under the Medium severity level."

This type of vulnerability occurs when a pointer is dereferenced without first checking for NULL, leading to a system crash or potential exploitation by an attacker. In this case, the impact is significant as it can result in denial of service or potential arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability does not require user interaction (UI:N) and has a high complexity of exploitation (AC:H). Since the vulnerability could lead to system compromise and significant disruption (A:H), the severity score is high (8.1), categorizing it as a High severity vulnerability."

A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)  during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade."

If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided description of the buggy code(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability.

The nature of stored XSS allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts into the comments section of the post, leading to code execution in the victim's browser. This type of vulnerability poses a significant threat as it can facilitate various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, cookie theft, and phishing. Considering the impact of a successful exploit, where an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's context, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system, this vulnerability warrants a High severity rating."

A vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`), where sensitive data is inadvertently printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs. In particular, functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`, `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`, and `tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its `Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. An unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing these prints of sensitive information, which may contain configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the system. This vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability. As a temporary measure until the patch can be applied, users can add the environment variable `DISABLE_TF_LOGS` to the tf-runners via the runner pod template of the Terraform Custom Resource. This will prevent the logging of sensitive information and mitigate the risk of this vulnerability."

This type of vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to write outside the intended memory range, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system compromise. Buffer overflows are a common target for attackers due to their ability to completely hijack the control of the affected application. Given the critical impact of heap-based buffer overflows on system integrity and the ease of exploitation once identified, this vulnerability is considered high severity. The high likelihood of successful exploitation and the significant consequences in terms of system compromise justifies the high severity rating."

        "description": "APIs to evaluate content with Velocity is a package for APIs to evaluate content with Velocity. Starting with version 2.3 and prior to 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0, the velocity scripts are not properly sandboxed against using the Java File API to perform read or write operations on the filesystem. Writing an attacking script in Velocity requires the Script rights in XWiki so not all users can use it, and it also requires finding an XWiki API which returns a File. The problem has been patched in versions 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0. There is no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than upgrading and being careful when giving Script rights.",

This type of vulnerability (CWE-79) can lead to code execution in users' browsers, potentially compromising their sessions or stealing sensitive data. The impact is mitigated to some extent by the fact that the restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner removes certain characters in attribute names, reducing the attack surface. However, the presence of this vulnerability and the potential for injecting malicious scripts warrant a Medium severity rating. The fix implemented in versions 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1, focusing on allowing only specific characters in data attributes, addresses the root cause. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version as there are no viable workarounds to mitigate this security risk effectively."

An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.\n💻 Technical Description *\nFix implemented by not allowing to modify object prototype.\n🐛 Proof of Concept (PoC) *\n\nCreate the following PoC file:\n\n// poc.js\nconst Baobab = require('baobab');\n\nconsole.log(`Before: ${{}.polluted}`)\ntree = new Baobab()\ntree.deepMerge(JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"polluted\": true}}'))\nconsole.log(`After: ${{}.polluted}`)\n\nExecute the following commands in terminal:\n\nnpm i baobab # Install affected module\nnode poc.js #  Run the PoC\n\nCheck the Output:\n\nBefore : undefined\nAfter : true\n\n🔥 Proof of Fix (PoF) *\nI've added unit tests for Prototype Pollution\n\n+1 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nI've executed unit tests.\nAfter fix the functionality is unaffected.",

In a Kirby site this can be used to alter site content, break site behavior or inject malicious data or code. The exact security risk depends on the field type and usage.\n\nKirby stores content of the site, of pages, files and users in text files by default.

When reading a KirbyData file, the affected code first removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards split the content into fields by the field separator.\n\nWhen writing to a KirbyData file, field separators in field data are escaped to prevent user input from interfering with the field structure.

Additionally, the privileges required are low (PR:L) and no user interaction is needed (UI:N), further mitigating the risk. The scope remains unchanged (S:U), and there is no direct impact on confidentiality (C:N), integrity (I:N), or availability (A:N). Based on these factors, the severity of this vulnerability is labeled as Low with a score of 3.1, indicating that while it poses a security concern, the overall risk is limited."

When authenticating users Symfony by default regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enables same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. This issue has been fixed in the 4.4 branch. \n\n",

This indicates a significant risk of unauthorized access to user credentials, potentially leading to account compromise. The vulnerability impacts all versions of Change Request, and while the exploitation requires specific user rights, the consequences can be severe if exploited. Considering the impact on confidentiality (exposure of password hashes) and integrity (potential account compromise), alongside the difficulty of exploitation which is not automated but can be achieved with user-level access, the severity level is determined to be High (7.0 - 8.9) based on CVSS V3.1."

If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided description of the buggy code(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the description indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."
