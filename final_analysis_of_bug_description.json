            "description": "Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.",

This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned.

Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server.

This function, nor those that call it, add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided, nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e., an IP address can be provided). As this function\u2019s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response, it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server, and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password.

This prevents attackers from creating a DNS entry that resolves to a local address space and using that url to attack a Mealie instance.\n\nAlso, note that these are mitigations, they are not 100% fixes.\nWhich issue(s) this PR fixes:\n\nCloses fix: Add 127.0.1.1 to exclude list\u00a0#3364\n\nSpecial notes for your reviewer:\nI've tested locally and all the automated testing should pass. If possible, I would like another reviewer to pull down these changes and attempt to\n\nScrape a few recipes from different domains\nUse the Scrape Image functionality to pull external images into Mealie from a few different domains.\n\nTesting\nSee Above",

Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, \u201cAV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L\u201d and \u201cAV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\u201d\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, \u201cAV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\u201d and \u201cAV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L\u201d\n4.
