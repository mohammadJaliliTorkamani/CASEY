The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)  during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry.

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is provided as:\n   Description: description of the bug\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description, list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

This allowed attackers to provide a password with a length up to the server's maximum request body length. Validating that password against the user's actual password requires hashing the provided password, which requires more CPU and memory resources (and therefore processing time) the longer the provided password gets. This could be abused by an attacker to cause the website to become unresponsive or unavailable. Because Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection, the impact of this vulnerability is limited to 10 failed logins from each IP address and 10 failed logins for each existing user per hour.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have added password length limits in the affected code so that passwords longer than 1000 bytes are immediately blocked, both when setting a password and when logging in.",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: )` to clear all the session attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.\nFile: src/Authenticator.ts\nHunks:\n<Hunk>\n\n</Hunk>\n<Hunk>\nthis.sessionManager = new

Since passwords are a critical asset, even hashed, their exposure could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and other systems. The vulnerability has a significant impact, especially in terms of confidentiality. Given the ease of exploitation for authenticated users and the high impact on confidentiality, the severity is rated as High (CVSS score: 8.8)."

        "content": "You are an expert in identifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on both the buggy method(s) and bug description.\n\nInstructions:\n1. * Input: You will receive one or more file names, each having one or more buggy hunks enclosed within <Hunk> and </Hunk>, and a description of the buggy code. If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is provided as:\n   Description: description of the bug\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description, list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

The vulnerability occurs when the code attempts to access or use memory that has already been freed, leading to potentially unpredictable behavior and system crashes. In this context, an attacker could craft a malicious input causing the program to access already deallocated memory, resulting in a denial of service condition. Since the impact involves disrupting the service, and the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit, the severity label is high."

A vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`), where sensitive data is inadvertently printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs. In particular, functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`, `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`, and `tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its `Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. An unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing these prints of sensitive information, which may contain configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the system. This vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability.

        "content": "You are an expert in identifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assessing the severity of vulnerabilities based on both the buggy method(s) and bug description.\n\nInstructions:\n1. * Input: You will receive one or more file names, each having one or more buggy hunks enclosed within <Hunk> and </Hunk>, and a description of the buggy code. If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is provided as:\n   Description: description of the bug\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description, list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) or its description (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the provided information indicates a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

      "EXPLANATION": "The provided buggy code snippets in 'ajax.tags.php' and 'tags.js' files indicate a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input validation. The code in 'tags.js' uses the 'replaceWith' method without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Additionally, the 'escape' function in 'tags.js' attempts to sanitize user input but may not cover all possible XSS vectors. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser session. Considering the impact of an XSS attack, which involves the potential theft of sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user, the severity is assessed as medium."

For more information, visit our website (https://huntr.dev/) or click the bounty URL below...\nQ | A\nVersion Affected | *\nBug Fix | YES\nOriginal Pull Request | 418sec#1\nVulnerability README | https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/npm/baobab/1/README.md\nUser Comments:\n📊 Metadata *\nbaobab is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.\nBounty URL: https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-baobab\n⚙️ Description *\nPrototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects.\nJavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as __proto__, constructor and prototype. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.\n💻 Technical Description *\nFix implemented by not allowing to modify object prototype.\n🐛 Proof of Concept (PoC) *\n\nCreate the following PoC file:\n\n// poc.js\nconst Baobab = require('baobab');\n\nconsole.log(`Before: ${{}.polluted}`)\ntree = new Baobab()\ntree.deepMerge(JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"polluted\": true}}'))\nconsole.log(`After: ${{}.polluted}`)\n\nExecute the following commands in terminal:\n\nnpm i baobab # Install affected module\nnode poc.js #  Run the PoC\n\nCheck the Output:\n\nBefore : undefined\nAfter : true\n\n🔥 Proof of Fix (PoF) *\nI've added unit tests for Prototype Pollution\n\n+1 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nI've executed unit tests.\nAfter fix the functionality is unaffected.",

Kirby sites are *not* affected if they don't allow write access for untrusted users or visitors.\n\nA field injection in a content storage implementation is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers with content write access to overwrite content fields that the site developer didn't intend to be modified. In a Kirby site this can be used to alter site content, break site behavior or inject malicious data or code. The exact security risk depends on the field type and usage.\n\nKirby stores content of the site, of pages, files and users in text files by default. The text files use Kirby's KirbyData format where each field is separated by newlines and a line with four dashes (`----`). When reading a KirbyData file, the affected code first removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards split the content into fields by the field separator.\n\nWhen writing to a KirbyData file, field separators in field data are escaped to prevent user input from interfering with the field structure. However this escaping could be tricked by including a Unicode BOM sequence in a field separator (e.g. `--\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF--`). When writing, this was not detected as a separator, but because the BOM was removed during reading, it could be abused by attackers to inject other field data into content files.\n\nBecause each field can only be defined once per content file, this vulnerability only affects fields in the content file that were defined above the vulnerable user-writable field or not at all. Fields that are defined below the vulnerable field override the injected field content and were therefore already protected.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6.

        "content": "Description: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields.

    "description": "Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

The lack of proper input validation in the '__' function that handles the 'editIssue' message allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the 'issueIdentification' parameter. When this vulnerable code is executed, it opens the door for an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information. The impact of this vulnerability is moderate as it requires some level of user interaction to trigger the attack, but it could still cause harm by affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the system. Hence, the severity label assigned to this vulnerability is medium (5.4) as per CVSS v3.1 guidelines."

Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."
