The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as a privileged local user could exploit it to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges. The nature of the bug, combined with the ability to control the faulting memory page, indicates a critical vulnerability. The ease of exploitation and the potential for system compromise lead to a high severity rating with a score of 8.6 according to CVSS v3.1."
