        "description": "KernelSU is a Kernel based root solution for Android. Starting in version 0.6.1 and prior to version 0.7.0, if a KernelSU installed device is infected with a malware whose app signing block specially constructed, it can take over root privileges on the device. The vulnerable verification logic actually obtains the signature of the last block with an id of `0x7109871a`, while the verification logic during Android installation is to obtain the first one. In addition to the actual signature upgrade that has been fixed (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V3), there is also the problem of actual signature downgrading (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V1). Find a condition in the signature verification logic that will cause the signature not to be found error, and KernelSU does not implement the same conditions, so KSU thinks there is a V2 signature, but the APK signature verification actually uses the V1 signature. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.0. As workarounds, keep the KernelSU manager installed and avoid installing unknown apps.",

        "description": "OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`).\n\nThe vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\\n`).\n\nBy abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.",

This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0.

        "description": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. Normally the value of the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.",

        "description": "jsonwebtoken is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification, other than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of  forged tokens. If your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function.

        "description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `StringNGrams` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory condition after an integer overflow. We are missing a validation on `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which is later used to allocate parts of the output. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",

Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. The malicious SVG can only be uploaded by crafting a custom request to the server with a fake MIME type. A patch in version 2.5.264 fixes this vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users.",

Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs.  `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS.

                "content": "You are an expert in identifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assessing the severity of vulnerabilities in software code.\n\nInstructions:\n1. * Input: You will receive one or more files, each has a file name, and one or more buggy hunks enclosed  within <Hunk> and </Hunk>. If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is as below:\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s), list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."
