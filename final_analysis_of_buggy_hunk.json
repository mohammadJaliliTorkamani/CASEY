The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.",

    "description": "stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating a squash filesystem.  Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible to craft an OCI tar archive that, when stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function, the  `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider` struct, or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function express this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI archive as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an OCI layout by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the unarchived directory to stereoscope.",

If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is as below:\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s), list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1.

This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems.

    "description": "Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42, there is a logic flaw in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string. However, passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. The vulnerability can be found in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()` function declared in `/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`. Version 1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue. End users should also ensure that `twig.undefined_functions` and `twig.undefined_filters` properties in `/path/to/webroot/system/config/system.yaml` configuration file are set to `false` to disallow Twig from treating undefined filters/functions as PHP functions and executing them.",

When the extended filter property `contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector, it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected database.

This affects users who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove `allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add `allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.",

    "description": "syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)  during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.",

This is NOT the desired behavior. Instead, this change updates the tag values so that the fields are ignored and not decoded onto the yaml or json outputs displayed by syft.\nNote - the code can still use these values, but they are no longer exposed as a part of any logging or encoded into SBOMs.\nAffects syft versions >= v0.69.0 && <0.70.0\nRelated Links:\n\nGHSA-jp7v-3587-2956\nCVE-2023-24827\n\nSigned-off-by: Christopher Phillips christopher.phillips@anchore.com",

If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is as below:\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s), list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

The `RaggedRangOp` function takes an argument `limits` that is eventually used to construct a `TensorShape` as an `int64`. If `limits` is a very large float, it can overflow when converted to an `int64`. This triggers an `InvalidArgument` but also throws an abort signal that crashes the program. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0.

    "description": "Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). The real-world impact of this vulnerability is limited, however we still recommend to update to one of the patch releases because they also fix more severe vulnerabilities.\n\nKirby's authentication endpoint did not limit the password length. This allowed attackers to provide a password with a length up to the server's maximum request body length. Validating that password against the user's actual password requires hashing the provided password, which requires more CPU and memory resources (and therefore processing time) the longer the provided password gets. This could be abused by an attacker to cause the website to become unresponsive or unavailable. Because Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection, the impact of this vulnerability is limited to 10 failed logins from each IP address and 10 failed logins for each existing user per hour.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have added password length limits in the affected code so that passwords longer than 1000 bytes are immediately blocked, both when setting a password and when logging in.",

If an admin sets up Redash versions 10.0.0 and prior without explicitly specifying the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` or `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, a default value is used for both that is the same across all installations. In such cases, the instance is vulnerable to attackers being able to forge sessions using the known default value. This issue only affects installations where the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET or REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables have not been explicitly set. This issue does not affect users of the official Redash cloud images, Redash's Digital Ocean marketplace droplets, or the scripts in the `getredash/setup` repository. These instances automatically generate unique secret keys during installation. One can verify whether one's instance is affected by checking the value of the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable.

    "description": "@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with `@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and `@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The `@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options: `clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields (default: )` to clear all the session attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in `clearSessionIgnoreFields`.",

Versions prior to 0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular expression `\\A+(?:\\/+)*\\z`.",

        "content": "You are an expert in identifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assessing the severity of vulnerabilities in software code.\n\nInstructions:\n1. * Input: You will receive one or more files, each has a file name, and one or more buggy hunks enclosed  within <Hunk> and </Hunk>. If there are multiple buggy hunks or files, they will be related to the same bug. The provided input structure is as below:\n   File: file_name\n   Hunks: \n        <Hunk> hunk 1 </Hunk>\n        <Hunk> hunk 2 </Hunk>\n        \n2. * Output: Generate a JSON object with the following structure:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [], \n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nOutput Details:\n- EXACT_CWE_IDS: If you identify any CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s), list them here (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS: List of top five alternative CWE IDs in the provided buggy hunk(s) (e.g., [\"CWE-123\"]). If no alternative CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- SEVERITY_LABEL: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity level (e.g., \"high\") based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the buggy hunk(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are found and severity is identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-123\", \"CWE-456\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-789\", \"CWE-152\", \"CWE-196\"],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs or severity are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

    "description": "Weave GitOps Terraform Controller (aka Weave TF-controller) is a controller for Flux to reconcile Terraform resources in a GitOps way. A vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`), where sensitive data is inadvertently printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs. In particular, functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`, `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`, and `tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its `Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. An unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing these prints of sensitive information, which may contain configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the system. This vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the vulnerability. As a temporary measure until the patch can be applied, users can add the environment variable `DISABLE_TF_LOGS` to the tf-runners via the runner pod template of the Terraform Custom Resource. This will prevent the logging of sensitive information and mitigate the risk of this vulnerability.",

The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. Prior to version 1.4.2, it allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to the `import()` function. This vulnerability has been patched in import-in-the-middle version 1.4.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values. If using import-in-the-middle, directly or indirectly, and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that no options are set, either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, that would enable loader hooks.",

    "description": "typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with typings for use with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds.",

Affected versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus halt due to non-deterministic behaviour in a ValidateBasic method in the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the x/authz module contains a Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration time for when the authorization grant expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that time is compared to the node’s local clock time. Any chain running an affected version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted by anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain.

This could lead to various attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting. However, the impact is limited as the privileges required are low and there is no direct user interaction needed for exploitation. The confidentiality and integrity impacts are low, with only availability being affected. Therefore, based on the CVSS V3.1 metrics, this vulnerability is rated as Low severity."

    "description": "NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability.",

In affected versions when a full CVSS v2.0 vector string is parsed using `ParseVector`, an Out-of-Bounds Read is possible due to a lack of tests. The Go module will then panic. The problem is patched in tag `v0.4.0`, by the commit `d9d478ff0c13b8b09ace030db9262f3c2fe031f4`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may avoid this issue by parsing only CVSS v2.0 vector strings that do not have all attributes defined (e.g. `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:M/IR:M/AR:M`). As stated in (https://github.com/pandatix/go-cvss/blob/master/SECURITY.md), the CPE v2.3 to refer to this Go module is `cpe:2.3:a:pandatix:go_cvss:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`. The entry has already been requested to the NVD CPE dictionary.",

Starting with version 2.3 and prior to 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0, the velocity scripts are not properly sandboxed against using the Java File API to perform read or write operations on the filesystem. Writing an attacking script in Velocity requires the Script rights in XWiki so not all users can use it, and it also requires finding an XWiki API which returns a File. The problem has been patched in versions 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0. There is no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than upgrading and being careful when giving Script rights.",

    "description": "jsonwebtoken is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification, other than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of  forged tokens. If your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function. This issue has been patched, please update to version 9.0.0.",

The HTML sanitizer, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid data attributes. This vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like `/` and `>` are removed in all attribute names. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.",

    "description": "openssh_key_parser is an open source Python package providing utilities to parse and pack OpenSSH private and public key files. In versions prior to 0.0.6 if a field of a key is shorter than it is declared to be, the parser raises an error with a message containing the raw field value. An attacker able to modify the declared length of a key's sensitive field can thus expose the raw value of that field. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.0.6, which no longer includes the raw field value in the error message. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",

An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.\n💻 Technical Description *\nFix implemented by not allowing to modify object prototype.\n🐛 Proof of Concept (PoC) *\n\nCreate the following PoC file:\n\n// poc.js\nconst Baobab = require('baobab');\n\nconsole.log(`Before: ${{}.polluted}`)\ntree = new Baobab()\ntree.deepMerge(JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"polluted\": true}}'))\nconsole.log(`After: ${{}.polluted}`)\n\nExecute the following commands in terminal:\n\nnpm i baobab # Install affected module\nnode poc.js #  Run the PoC\n\nCheck the Output:\n\nBefore : undefined\nAfter : true\n\n🔥 Proof of Fix (PoF) *\nI've added unit tests for Prototype Pollution\n\n+1 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nI've executed unit tests.\nAfter fix the functionality is unaffected.",

In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions.

    "description": "Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to update a Kirby content file (e.g. via a contact or comment form). Kirby sites are *not* affected if they don't allow write access for untrusted users or visitors.\n\nA field injection in a content storage implementation is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers with content write access to overwrite content fields that the site developer didn't intend to be modified. In a Kirby site this can be used to alter site content, break site behavior or inject malicious data or code. The exact security risk depends on the field type and usage.\n\nKirby stores content of the site, of pages, files and users in text files by default. The text files use Kirby's KirbyData format where each field is separated by newlines and a line with four dashes (`----`). When reading a KirbyData file, the affected code first removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards split the content into fields by the field separator.\n\nWhen writing to a KirbyData file, field separators in field data are escaped to prevent user input from interfering with the field structure. However this escaping could be tricked by including a Unicode BOM sequence in a field separator (e.g. `--\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF--`). When writing, this was not detected as a separator, but because the BOM was removed during reading, it could be abused by attackers to inject other field data into content files.\n\nBecause each field can only be defined once per content file, this vulnerability only affects fields in the content file that were defined above the vulnerable user-writable field or not at all. Fields that are defined below the vulnerable field override the injected field content and were therefore already protected.\n\nThe problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have fixed the affected code to only remove the Unicode BOM sequence at the beginning of the file. This fixes this vulnerability both for newly written as well as for existing content files.",

    "description": "Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.",

This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2.

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

Change request allows to edit any page by default, and the changes are then exported in an XML file that anyone can download. So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing an edit on the user profiles and then downloading the XML file that has been created. This is also true for any document that might contain password field and that a user can view.\nThis vulnerability impacts all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have the Change request right (allowed by default) and view rights on the page to target. This issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated way. The patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages that contains a password field with change request. It means that already existing change request for those pages won't be removed by the patch, administrators needs to take care of it. The patch is provided in Change Request 1.10, administrators should upgrade immediately. It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by denying manually the Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki space which will include any user profile by default.",

    "description": "Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. In all current versions of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

We'll also be a requesting a CVE for this vulnerability, to be referenced in this ticket.\nWhat does this fix?\nFilter expressions containing __ generally should not be allowed, because they can be used in an explloit.\nWhat is the new behavior?\nFilter expressions containing __ are generally rejected, unless they're:\n\nexplicitly allowlisted in DATA_MANAGER_FILTER_ALLOWLIST\nfilters of the task.data field, which is a JSONField (and from which foreign key relationships cannot be traversed).\n\nWhat is the current behavior?\nFilter expressions containing __ are allowed\nWhat libraries were added/updated?\n(list all with version changes)\nDoes this change affect performance?\n(if so describe the impacts positive or negative)\nDoes this change affect security?\nYes, it addresses the ORM Leak vulnerability that currently exists in Data Manager\nWhat alternative approaches were there?\nA more structured search API would be a safer choice, but would also be much higher-effort to implement.\nWhat feature flags were used to cover this change?\nDATA_MANAGER_FILTER_ALLOWLIST env var\nDoes this PR introduce a breaking change?\n(check only one)\n\n Yes, and covered entirely by feature flag(s)\nnote: it's covered by an env var, not a feature flag, in this case.\n Yes, and covered partially by feature flag(s)\n No\n Not sure (briefly explain the situation below)\n\nWhat level of testing was included in the change?\n(check all that apply)\n\n e2e\n integration\n unit\n\nWhich logical domain(s) does this change affect?\nData Manager",
