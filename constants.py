5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”

Note: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase.

Base Metrics:
1.	Attack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))
2.	Attack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))
3.	Privileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))
4.	User Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))
5.	Scope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))
6.	Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))

Severity Levels and Example Combinations:
1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”
2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”
3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”
4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”
5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”
