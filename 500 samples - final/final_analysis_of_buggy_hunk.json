OpenPGP subkeys are associated with a primary key via a \"binding signature.\" RPM does not check the binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them.

Prior to version 1.12.2, using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As a workaround, users who process based on user input should always sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of operations.",

A security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint, allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with the key \"not so secret\". The vulnerability can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted. Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme, where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s` query parameters). This authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/`, which is expected to be most instances in a standard deployment, and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected). This issue has been patched in version 0.50.2.\n",

If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem has existed since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis versions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disabling Unix sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix socket file in a protected directory.",

        "description": "Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native distributed dataset orchestrator and accelerator for data-intensive applications. Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to version 0.8.6, if a malicious user gains control of a Kubernetes node running fluid csi pod (controlled by the `csi-nodeplugin-fluid` node-daemonset), they can leverage the fluid-csi service account to modify specs of all the nodes in the cluster. However, since this service account lacks `list node` permissions, the attacker may need to use other techniques to identify vulnerable nodes.\n\nOnce the attacker identifies and modifies the node specs, they can manipulate system-level-privileged components to access all secrets in the cluster or execute pods on other nodes. This allows them to elevate privileges beyond the compromised node and potentially gain full privileged access to the whole cluster.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker can make all other nodes unschedulable (for example, patch node with taints) and wait for system-critical components with high privilege to appear on the compromised node. However, this attack requires two prerequisites: a compromised node and identifying all vulnerable nodes through other means.\n\nVersion 0.8.6 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, delete the `csi-nodeplugin-fluid` daemonset in `fluid-system` namespace and avoid using CSI mode to mount FUSE file systems. Alternatively, using sidecar mode to mount FUSE file systems is recommended.",

Improper validation makes it possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP method. The vulnerability occurs only if the attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST etc.) of the request. If the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request it will be able to modify the request (request smuggling). This issue has been patched in version 3.9.0.",

If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to null.\n- SEVERITY_SCORE: If the buggy code(s) has a security vulnerability (CVE) considering predicted CWE_IDs, provide its severity score as a float number based on CVSS V3.1 . If there are no vulnerabilities, set this field to -1.\n- SEVERITY_EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct severity label for this vulnerability. Consider key factors such as vulnerability nature (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If a severity assessment is identified:\n   {\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"SEVERITY_EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no severity assessment identified:\n   {\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"SEVERITY_EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

        "description": "Label Studio is a popular open source data labeling tool. The vulnerability affects all versions of Label Studio prior to 1.11.0 and was tested on version 1.8.2. Label Studio's SSRF protections that can be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is because the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS lookup to verify that the IP address is not in an excluded subnet range. This protection can be bypassed by either using HTTP redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack.",

The first hunk shows a condition where memory allocation can fail if the data pointer is not null. The second hunk enforces a condition where the data_size should not exceed a specific value (0x10000000) before allocating memory. Subsequently, memory is allocated based on data_size in the fourth hunk without proper verification of the allocation's success. If the allocation fails, it returns MYSOFA_NO_MEMORY in the sixth hunk. This memory allocation vulnerability could lead to denial of service if an attacker triggers the allocation failure by providing a large data_size value. Considering the impact on system availability if this vulnerability is exploited and the potential for a DoS attack, the severity label assigned is Medium."

In affected versions DDFFileParser` and `DefaultDDFFileValidator` (and so `ObjectLoader`) are vulnerable to `XXE Attacks`. A DDF file is a LWM2M format used to store LWM2M object description. Leshan users are impacted only if they parse untrusted DDF files (e.g. if they let external users provide their own model), in that case they MUST upgrade to fixed version. If you parse only trusted DDF file and validate only with trusted xml schema, upgrading is not mandatory.  This issue has been fixed in versions 1.5.0 and 2.0.0-M13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

Group parameter is posted along when navigating between organizational subgroups (groups.php file). Status parameter is used in multiple files to change a status of an entity such as making a project, task, or user inactive. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.33.5607. An upgrade is highly recommended. If an upgrade is not practical, introduce ttValidStatus function as in the latest version and start using it user input check blocks wherever status field is used. For groups.php fix, introduce ttValidInteger function as in the latest version and use it in the access check block in the file.",

On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects all together.",

        "description": "Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer. There is no known workaround for this vulnerability.",

Engrampa is found to be vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve full Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the target. While handling CPIO archives, the Engrampa Archive manager follows symlink, cpio by default will follow stored symlinks while extracting and the Archiver will not check the symlink location, which leads to arbitrary file writes to unintended locations. When the victim extracts the archive, the attacker can craft a malicious cpio or ISO archive to achieve RCE on the target system. This vulnerability was fixed in commit 63d5dfa.\n",

In my testing, updating the product correctly updates the file name for it and although the file name isn't updated for orders, the order fetches the download through the product's configuration itself and not from the order config, so it's actually unused.\nWe could update the file name as well, but that would require us to loop through each downloadable order type, decode the config from JSON to an array, check if it needed to be updated, and then update it which is a lot of added complexity and wasted resources for a value that's not necessary to update.",

        "description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258.",

In affected versions an attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an repo. This is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should secure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is another potential issue that might arise from improper handling of the imported module. Additionally, CWE-94 (Code Injection) could be relevant if the 'orjson' module is used to process user-controlled data without proper validation. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) and CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) could also be considered depending on the context of how the 'orjson' module is utilized in the code."

        "description": "Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected versions several files within the local working directory are included during the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user. As such, under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to local privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files. All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar's self-update. The following scenarios are of high risk: Composer being run with sudo, Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects, Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on the same project. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 2.7.0 and 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliest convenience. Where not possible, the following should be addressed: Remove all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilege escalation, and avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory, or if needed, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php` and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code.  A reset can also be done on these files by the following:```sh\nrm vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php\ncomposer install --no-scripts --no-plugins\n```",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

        "description": "Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versions unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot \"public_mode\" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal path: /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot \"public_mode\" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.",

        "description": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10, HTML comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced that ensures that comments don't start with `>`. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n",

        "description": "Sydent is an identity server for the Matrix communications protocol. Prior to version 2.5.6, if configured to send emails using TLS, Sydent does not verify SMTP servers' certificates. This makes  Sydent's emails vulnerable to interception via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Attackers with privileged access to the network can intercept room invitations and address confirmation emails. This is patched in Sydent 2.5.6. When patching, make sure that Sydent trusts the certificate of the server it is connecting to. This should happen automatically when using properly issued certificates. Those who use self-signed certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority certificate, or their self signed certificate if using only one, to the trust store of your operating system. As a workaround, one can ensure Sydent's emails fail to send by setting the configured SMTP server to a loopback or non-routable address under one's control which does not have a listening SMTP server.",

Therefore, based on the difficulty of exploitation and limited impact, the severity of this CVE is categorized as Low."

CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is relevant as there is a risk of special characters in $_POST being mishandled. CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences) applies as the code doesn't sanitize input, exposing it to CRLF injection attacks. Finally, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a generic concern given the lack of validation on user input."

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

        "description": "Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.",

        "description": "Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk “AES” transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an “aes” transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the “aes” transform and provides an improved “aes256” transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.",

Lastly, CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) is worth considering, as the code relies on user input for a critical security evaluation without proper verification."

On making a request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are not expected or required.",

This CWE is relevant as the 'expirecache' function operates on external data without validating the source or content, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, CWE-943 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) may apply if the cache expiration mechanism relies on predictable or insufficiently random inputs. Moreover, CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is considered if the function output is not properly encoded before being used in a different context, posing a risk of injection attacks. CWE-134 (Use of Externally-Controlled Format String) is also relevant if the function's input can impact the format string, exposing the application to format string vulnerabilities. Lastly, CWE-210 (Improper Input Validation) could be a concern if the function does not adequately validate the input, leaving room for various attacks."

The 'url' parameter is directly constructed using user input without proper validation, potentially leading to an open redirect vulnerability. CWE-89 (SQL Injection) is relevant due to the lack of input sanitization in the URL building process. CWE-200 (Information Exposure) is a concern as sensitive information like record ids is being transmitted over the network. CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) applies because the 'id' parameter comes directly from user input, influencing a security-related decision. Lastly, CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is mentioned as the URL might allow malicious files to be uploaded without proper validation."

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

Additionally, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) applies broadly, as minimal input validation risks various injection attacks. CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is relevant as file paths use user inputs, which could enable unauthorized access if mishandled.

Consider key factors such as vulnerability nature (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, access control), its impact on system security, and potential exploitation. Explain how the CVE bug functions, what kind of security breach it leads to, and how these characteristics influence your decision to assign a specific severity label.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If a severity assessment is identified:\n   {\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": \"high\",\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": 8.3,\n     \"SEVERITY_EXPLANATION\": \"In assessing this CVE, the first step is to identify the nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper input validation leading to potential code injection. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary commands. Next, I consider the impact of this exploitation. Since the CVE describes remote access capabilities, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to fully compromise the system. This makes the potential damage quite significant, particularly if it can lead to data loss or control over critical systems. Given the ease of exploitation and the high impact on system integrity and availability, this CVE should be labeled as High severity.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no severity assessment identified:\n   {\n     \"SEVERITY_LABEL\": null,\n     \"SEVERITY_SCORE\": -1,\n     \"SEVERITY_EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure. Do not include any additional fields, descriptions, or text.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Guide:\n\nBase Metrics:\n1.\tAttack Vector (AV): How the vulnerability is exploited (Network (N), Adjacent Network (A), Local (L), Physical (P))\n2.\tAttack Complexity (AC): Difficulty of exploitation (Low (L), High (H))\n3.\tPrivileges Required (PR): Level of required privileges an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n4.\tUser Interaction (UI): Need for user interaction (None (N), Required (R))\n5.\tScope (S): Impact on other components (Unchanged (U), Changed (C))\n6.\tConfidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): Impact on security properties (None (N), Low (L), High (H))\n\nSeverity Levels and Example Combinations:\n1. None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

In versions prior to 0.8.4, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a GET request on lines 339-343 in `request.py`, which leads to a server-side request forgery. This issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on behalf of the server.

        "description": "PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown` markdown project. In affected versions an arbitrary file read is possible when using include file syntax. By using the syntax `--8<--\"/etc/passwd\"` or `--8<--\"/proc/self/environ\"` the content of these files will be rendered in the generated documentation. Additionally, a path relative to a specified, allowed base path can also be used to render the content of a file outside the specified base paths: `--8<-- \"../../../../etc/passwd\"`. Within the Snippets extension, there exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The vulnerable section exists in `get_snippet_path(self, path)` lines 155 to 174 in snippets.py. Any readable file on the host where the plugin is executing may have its content exposed. This can impact any use of Snippets that exposes the use of Snippets to external users. It is never recommended to use Snippets to process user-facing, dynamic content. It is designed to process known content on the backend under the control of the host, but if someone were to accidentally enable it for user-facing content, undesired information could be exposed. This issue has been addressed in version 10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict relative paths by filtering input.",

This can lead to a script injection attack. Additionally, CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is relevant as the $edit_post_id and $menu_id variables are directly used in function calls that could manipulate file paths or include external files leading to unauthorized access. Furthermore, CWE-95 (Eval Injection) could be a concern if the loadPostEditForm and loadPostAddForm functions dynamically evaluate the input resulting in code execution vulnerabilities. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) applies broadly due to the lack of input validation which can lead to various injection attacks, and CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) could also be applicable for failing to properly encode user input in output."

        "description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.",

        "description": " silverstripe-graphql is a package which serves Silverstripe data in GraphQL representations. An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas. If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk. This issue has been addressed in versions 3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, and 5.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

This creates a vulnerability where attackers can manipulate the SQL query to execute unauthorized commands. Furthermore, CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) could also be relevant if user input is passed to system commands. CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) applies as the user inputs are not properly encoded before being used in the SQL query. Additionally, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a concern here as there is no validation of the input data, which could lead to various injection attacks. Lastly, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) might be applicable if this code snippet is part of an authentication process and lacks proper authentication checks."

High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

        "description": "Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which is later used to parse the svg file, parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified, it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution, depending on available classes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version 2.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

When initialising a oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`. authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue.",

Affected versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus halt due to non-deterministic behaviour in a ValidateBasic method in the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the x/authz module contains a Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration time for when the authorization grant expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that time is compared to the node’s local clock time. Any chain running an affected version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted by anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain.

        "description": "discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely constructs a shell string using the file parameter, which can potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method, then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access. This issue has been addressed in code, but a new release of the `discordrb` gem has not been uploaded to rubygems. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2022-094`.",

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

None (0.0): This vulnerability is extremely difficult to exploit and has minimal impact. For example, “AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:N”\n2. Low (0.1 - 3.9): These vulnerabilities are somewhat difficult to exploit or have limited impact. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N”\n3. Medium (4.0 - 6.9): Involves vulnerabilities that are exploitable and could cause moderate damage. For example, “AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L”\n4. High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.16` of `vm2`.\n",

The system using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes.

High (7.0 - 8.9): Represents vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit and have significant consequences. For example, “AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L” and “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L”\n5. Critical (9.0 - 10.0): These vulnerabilities are both easy to exploit and have a devastating impact. For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

The first hunk introduces a 'UserID' field that is marked as 'required,' indicating that this field must be present. If proper validation checks are not in place, this could lead to input validation vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. The second hunk introduces a 'Status' field with specific enum values ('normal', 'suspended', 'deleted', 'inactive'). However, there is a risk of improper access control or insecure direct object reference (IDOR) if access checks are not properly implemented. While these issues may have a moderate impact depending on the overall system architecture and data sensitivity, the ease of exploitation and potential consequences warrant a Medium severity rating."

While the code snippet itself does not exhibit any immediate security vulnerabilities, the use of a cryptographic hash warrants careful consideration. The impact of a successful attack targeting this vulnerability would be limited due to the cryptographic nature of SHA-512, which is considered strong. Additionally, the attack vector is not specified, assuming a default 'Network' vector. Considering the low impact and difficulty of exploitation, along with no privilege requirements, this vulnerability falls into the Low severity category."

CWE-15 (External Control of System or Configuration Setting) is relevant if 'timestamp' is externally controlled, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) could be a consideration if 'prid' is used to store sensitive information without proper encryption.

In GoCD versions prior to 22.1.0, it is possible for existing authenticated users who have permissions to edit or create pipeline materials or pipeline configuration repositories to get remote code execution capability on the GoCD server via configuring a malicious branch name which abuses Mercurial hooks/aliases to exploit a command injection weakness. An attacker would require access to an account with existing GoCD administration permissions to either create/edit (`hg`-based) configuration repositories; create/edit pipelines and their (`hg`-based) materials; or, where \"pipelines-as-code\" configuration repositories are used, to commit malicious configuration to such an external repository which will be automatically parsed into a pipeline configuration and (`hg`) material definition by the GoCD server. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. As a workaround, users who do not use/rely upon Mercurial materials can uninstall/remove the `hg`/Mercurial binary from the underlying GoCD Server operating system or Docker image.",

If no CWEs are found, leave this as an empty array [].\n- CWE_EXPLANATION: Provide a step-by-step reasoning to identify the exact CWE and top five CWE IDs. This should include code analysis and references to CWE guidelines where relevant.\n\nExample Outputs:\n1. If CWEs are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-79\", \"CWE-89\"],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [\"CWE-79\", \"CWE-89\", \"CWE-20\", \"CWE-22\", \"CWE-352\"],\n     \"CWE_EXPLANATION\": \"In analyzing the code, CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) is identified due to unsanitized user input rendered in HTML output. CWE-89 (SQL Injection) is determined, as user input is embedded in SQL statements without parameterization, allowing query manipulation. Additionally, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) applies broadly, as minimal input validation risks various injection attacks. CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is relevant as file paths use user inputs, which could enable unauthorized access if mishandled. Lastly, CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is considered due to the absence of request verification, creating potential vulnerabilities in authenticated sessions.\"\n   }\n\n2. If no CWEs are identified:\n   {\n     \"EXACT_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"TOP_FIVE_CWE_IDS\": [],\n     \"CWE_EXPLANATION\": null\n   }\n\nImportant: Your output must strictly follow the described JSON structure.
