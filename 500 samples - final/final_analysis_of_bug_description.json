In my testing, updating the product correctly updates the file name for it and although the file name isn't updated for orders, the order fetches the download through the product's configuration itself and not from the order config, so it's actually unused.\nWe could update the file name as well, but that would require us to loop through each downloadable order type, decode the config from JSON to an array, check if it needed to be updated, and then update it which is a lot of added complexity and wasted resources for a value that's not necessary to update.",

This type of vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions, leading to potential account takeover or data theft. Since the exploit does not require user interaction (UI:N) and can be triggered with low privileges (PR:L), it presents a high risk of remote code execution. The impact of this vulnerability on Confidentiality (C:H), Integrity (I:H), and Availability (A:L) can be severe, with the potential for compromising sensitive data and disrupting the system. Overall, considering the ease of exploitation and the significant consequences, this CVE should be labeled as High severity."

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. Considering the nature of this security flaw and its impact on system security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), it is crucial to assign a high severity level. The attack vector for this vulnerability is likely network-based, as it involves remote exploitation. The attack complexity could be low to medium depending on the specific exploitation technique. The privileges required may vary but can be considered low to high depending on the affected components. User interaction is usually not required, and the scope might change due to the potential compromise of the authentication mechanism.

Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available."

Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available."

For example, “AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H” and “AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H”\n\nNote: The severity level may change based on specific characteristics of the vulnerability. For example, if the attack vector is physical but the impact on availability is high, the severity might increase."

Additionally, a path relative to a specified, allowed base path can also be used to render the content of a file outside the specified base paths: `--8<-- \"../../../../etc/passwd\"`. Within the Snippets extension, there exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The vulnerable section exists in `get_snippet_path(self, path)` lines 155 to 174 in snippets.py. Any readable file on the host where the plugin is executing may have its content exposed. This can impact any use of Snippets that exposes the use of Snippets to external users. It is never recommended to use Snippets to process user-facing, dynamic content. It is designed to process known content on the backend under the control of the host, but if someone were to accidentally enable it for user-facing content, undesired information could be exposed.

The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method, then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system access.
