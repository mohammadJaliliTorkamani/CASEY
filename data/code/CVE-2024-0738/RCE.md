The system has a remote code execution vulnerability.

Lock the dangerous function eval() through code search, which usually triggers expression injection. The main function
of this code is to execute custom execution logic for decision nodes.

Through code tracing, it was found that the eval method is implemented based on the ExpressionEngine interface.

The getEngine method is a static method that will be automatically called when ExpressionUtil is instantiated. Finally,
locate the configuration file, and based on the file content, it can be inferred that the eval() method recognizes SPEL
expressions.

Vulnerability verification:  
By calling the chain, it is found that the eval() method is triggered starting from the instance startup interface. It
is worth noting that it is only triggered when executing the decision model, which means that the processing process
needs to have judgment conditions.
